The molecule in your blood that picks up and releases oxygen is Hemoglobin (abbreviated Hb). Hemoglobin binds to 4 oxygen molecules to form the complex Hb(O2)4. But, how does Hb "know" when to pick up or let go of oxygen? What if you were running from a tiger and Hb just forgot to give O2 to your muscles?
