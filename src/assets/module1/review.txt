To sum up, reversible reactions are common in chemical and biological systems. Our bodies rely on these kinds of reactions to do things like transport oxygen from the lungs to the muscles. LeChatlier figured out that reversible reactions will always try to reach chemical equilibrium. Equilibrium is when the concentrations of the reactants and products are no longer changing because the forward and reverse rates are the same. 

If you add more reactants or take away products (i.e., cause a stress to the system), the system will adjust back towards a new equilibrium state - that's LeChatlier's Principle [REF to module]. You can even calculate and predict these changes in concentration using Limiting Reagent Calculations, as we'll see in lessons [give name/number and LINK to next lesson and other relevant lessons]. First, let's examine some of these new concepts in more detail [link to next lesson].
